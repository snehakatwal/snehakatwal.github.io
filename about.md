Currently, I am a Machine Learning Intern at Real Time Solutions Pvt. Ltd., where I work on intelligent systems that integrate deep learning with practical applications. I am passionate about using technology to solve real-world problems, particularly in computer vision, automation, and inclusive tech.

With experience ranging from backend systems to hardware design and creative branding, I bring a unique blend of technical and visual skills to every project.
